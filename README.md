## Nisin-like biosynthetic gene clusters are widespread and diverse in Microbiomes
This repo describes the genome mining for novel nisin variants. 
HMMER was first used to search nr database and MGNIFY for core peptides. LanB was also searched into the nr database. ncbi-genome-download was used to download assemblies from Genbank. MGNIFY genomes were manually downloaed. Genome annotations were standardised using Bakta with database v5.
